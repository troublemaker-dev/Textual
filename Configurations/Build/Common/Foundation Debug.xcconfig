// On Xcode 16, Textual failed to run in debug mode because
// a "Textual.debug.dylib" file was missing in the @rpath
// of extensions and services. Going to disable this feature
// of Xcode until a later release of Xcode.
//
// From Xcode 16 beta 1 release notes:
//
// Some large or complex projects may fail to build and
// run if they are scanning for specific Mach-O sections
// in their binaries. (123416939)
//
// Workaround: Try setting the build setting ENABLE_DEBUG_DYLIB=NO.
// This will disable the debug dylib that enables the new preview
// execution mode. Setting this to NO will still allow you to
// preview in Xcode 16 Seed 1 using the legacy execution mode,
// but support for this mode will be removed in a future build.
